#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Peter Borocz

* Introduction
  My Emacs setup after decadal bankruptcy filing.

  The configuration depends on Org mode. Specifically [[file:init.el][init.el]] sets up a few initial GUI settings, bootstraps
  [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], and loads [[file:config.org][config.org]], which is where the majority of the configuration magic happens.
* Notes
  I've been using ~(require 'xxx)~ since 1990. November, 2022 is my /first/ attempt at using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]
  over an above simply cutting/pasting other people's usage. There's a LOT to be cleaned up so
  don't take my usage as idiomatic!
