#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Peter Borocz
#+OPTION: todo:t

* Introduction
  My Emacs setup after decadal bankruptcy filing.

  The configuration depends on Org mode. Specifically [[file:init.el][init.el]] sets up a few initial GUI settings, bootstraps
  [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], and loads [[file:config.org][config.org]], which is where the majority of the configuration magic happens.
* Notes
  I've been happily using ~(require 'xxx)~ since 1990. However, startup times have continued to
  ramp up (albeit only once per day at most).

  Thus, this repo reflects my /first/ attempt at actually cleaning up and using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] over
  an above simply cutting/pasting other people's usage.

  There's a LOT to be cleaned up and learned so don't take my usage as idiomatic!
