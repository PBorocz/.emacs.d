#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Peter Borocz
#+OPTION: todo:t

* Introduction
The configuration depends on Org mode. Specifically [[file:init.el][init.el]] sets up a few initial GUI settings, bootstraps [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], and loads [[file:config.org][config.org]] (where the majority of the configuration magic happens)

--> [[file:config.org][Configuration (config.org)]]

* Notes
I've been happily using ~(require 'xxx)~ since 1990 (really, see some of my history at the bottom of [[file:config.org][config.org]]).

However, startup times have continued to ramp up (albeit only once per day at most).

Thus, this repo reflects my /first/ attempt at actually cleaning up and using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] over an above simply cutting/pasting other people's usage.

There's a LOT to be cleaned up and learned so don't take my usage as idiomatic!
